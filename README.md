# tomb-of-the-dread-beast

A _quick_ adventure to learn the art of text adventure creation.

**WARNING** If you want to play this game, whenever if it is finished, reading through the source code (story.ni) would be a spoiler.

## Quick Adventure Idea

The idea was to create generate an idea for a text adventure and then create a quick adventure game that would satisfy the idea.

1. Generate a one page dungeon to a PDF using [One Page Dungeon](https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon): try not to do any editing!
2. Use [Trizbort](https://www.trizbort.com/) to create the basic rooms and all the items in the dungeon: don't subtract anything!
3. Export this to Inform, flesh it out, and learn something.
4. Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for any diagraming like a quest path.

Could also skip Trizbort and just do it all in Inform of course.

I still think this is a good idea. But, this _quick_ adventure became something that has been sitting in my queue, unfinished, for years.

I noticed that OneDrive doesn't really like the multitude of files inside an Inform project so I've moved it out of there and thought a Github repo would be nice. If I ever finish it _enough_ I'll add a release and instructions to play it! Such excitement.

I still haven't seen computer graphics that compete with seeing the scenes in text adventures in my head.
